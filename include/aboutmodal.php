                    I'm a native San Franciscan and have a passion for web development, gaming, sports and fitness. Iâ€™m a life-long learner who's looking to join a team where I can continue to learn, grow, and have some fun along the way.</p>

                    <p>I started my tech career in Customer Support answering phones and emails while paying my way through college. During my time at Zynga, I've collected multiple studio awards and a department award in the Customer Support.</p>

                    <p>From there, I moved into Community Management and collected a few more studio awards. I've also dipped my hand into game design by making several successful and highly profitable in-game features. It was an awesome experience to see positive feedback from the players. I then discovered that I wanted to make epic things that people are going to enjoy. I started to learn how to code on my own because it could help me diagnose issues with the game.</p>

                    <p>After getting laid off, I decided to take my learning a step further and  enrolled into Dev Bootcamp in late 2014. I graduated January 2015.</p>

                    <p>I decided to start a new adventure with the LeEco. Our team built and published the company Wordpress site where I remained as the volunteer webmaster for the India and US sites. I worked closely with Marketing to incorporate new features and content to the site keep it fresh and engaging. Then I moved onto our E-commerce platform team where I continue to introduce new and complelling features. I played an important part in the creation and launch of the US-Chinese site on LeEco.com.</p>
